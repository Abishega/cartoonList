## Code Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **/pages**: Contains all the Next.js page components (e.g., `browse.tsx`, `[id].tsx` for dynamic routes).
- **/components**: Reusable UI components such as `Card`, `SearchBar`, etc.
- **/services**: API calls and logic for fetching cartoon data.
- **/utils**: Utility functions and type definitions (e.g., `Cartoon` type).
- **/tests**: Unit tests for components and pages.

The project uses Next.js's dynamic routing feature for pages, with [id].tsx handling cartoon details based on the ID parameter.
